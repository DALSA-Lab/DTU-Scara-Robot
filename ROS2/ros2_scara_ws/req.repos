  # Build moveit visual tools from source as well, since the 'moveit_motion_plans' package depends on it.
  # Rosdep would install it, but the binary depends on a lot of moveit packages which would automatically be installed as well.
  # We could remove them before building with `sudo apt remove ros-$ROS_DISTRO-moveit*` but that would remove the visual tools again well.

  # The same for pick_ik. This has moveit-core as a dependency so when `sudo apt remove ros-$ROS_DISTRO-moveit*` is called pick-ik is also removed
  # to avoid leaving it broken. Include it from source. TODO: remove this when pick_ik is not used (IKFast?)
